// A RuntimeError is raised (by panic) when a program cannot continue: a
// non-exhaustive match, applying a non-function, a non-number passed to an
// arithmetic primitive, a malformed argument to write. It carries what is needed
// to report the failure in the programmer's terms: a message, the source span of
// the offending expression (when known), and a reduction trace.
//
// The trace is the closest thing a lazy language has to a stack trace. The Go call
// stack is useless here — a thunk is built in one place and forced in another, so
// the host stack does not mirror the program's logical call structure. Instead the
// machine records the names of the bindings (let / module / pattern) whose
// evaluation was in progress when the error happened; see collectTrace in
// machine.go. Anonymous intermediate thunks are skipped, leaving a readable
// skeleton like `while reducing: a → b → c`.
//
// RuntimeError is recovered at the run boundary (Run in machine.go). Bare,
// non-RuntimeError panics are left to propagate with their Go stack trace: they
// indicate a compiler/machine bug, not a program error.
