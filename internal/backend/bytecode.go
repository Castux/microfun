// The bytecode is flat: one Instr slice for the whole program (see Program.Code),
// not a tree of nested blocks. Every body — the program, each module binding,
// each lambda case, each thunk — is a contiguous span of that one array, reached
// by its start PC. A thunk or closure value therefore holds an integer PC, not a
// pointer to a sub-block. This "assembly, not a tree" layout — one dense array —
// is friendlier to the instruction cache and gives a single uniform notion of
// "run instructions from PC P".
//
// One instruction set covers both building values and matching patterns. A lambda
// case compiles to its match instructions —
// each tag test jumping to the next case on failure — followed immediately by its
// body instructions; there is no separate matcher IR. Building never forces; the
// match and Prim instructions are the only ones that force, and they do so through
// the machine's re-entrant WHNF.

// PC is re-exported from the value package, where Thunk and Closure store entry
// points; the two definitions are the same int32 alias.
