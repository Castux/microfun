// A Value is one runtime value, passed around by value (not by pointer). It is a
// small tagged union: a Number lives inline in Num, while every compound or
// heap-resident value keeps a pointer in Ref. This is the deliberate alternative
// to a Go interface for the runtime representation:
//
//   - A number never allocates. A float64 boxed into an interface{} heap-allocates
//     on every arithmetic result; Value{Tag: NumberTag, Num: x} does not. Numeric
//     programs allocate the most, so this is where the representation earns its
//     keep.
//   - Ref holds a *pointer* (to Cons, Tuple, …). A pointer stored in an interface
//     does NOT allocate in Go, so compound values pay only their own heap cost,
//     never an extra box.
//   - The Tag makes the variant explicit and cheap to switch on, instead of a
//     type switch on an interface's dynamic type.

// A Thunk is a deferred computation that memoises its result. It comes in three
// forms, distinguished without a tag field:
//
//   - Read != nil — a stdin stream cell; forcing it calls Read to obtain its weak
//     head normal form (a cons cell or the empty list) and reads one input item.
//   - Code == NoCode — a graph indirection (a pattern binding); forcing it reduces
//     the value already in Value and memoises the result. This keeps the bound
//     name on the trace/show path without the name's owner having to re-evaluate.
//   - Code >= 0 — a compiled thunk; forcing it runs the body at Code over the
//     captured frames (whole-frame capture, see below).
//
// Code thunks capture the entire enclosing activation (Locals and Upvalues) by
// reference and address it with the enclosing slot numbers — no renumbering, and
// mutual recursion in a let group resolves because every binding thunk shares the
// frame, which is fully populated before any binding is forced.
//
// Update distinguishes call-by-need from call-by-name (observable through peek
// nested in a re-forced expression): let, module, and pattern bindings memoise
// (Update true); anonymous argument, field, and pipe thunks re-run on each
// force (Update false). The output builtins return their argument forced, so a
// consumer of a show/write result does not redo the printed work.
